SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter

use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables

goal dentify a column that is compatible with string data.

you should know UNION conditions:
    - tables must have the same number of colums 
    - tables must have the datatype


#step1 determine number of coulumn
    way1:
        determined the number of columns
        try1
        -select ? of table UNION Null
        ->server error mean that the number of col are not equal 
        try2
        -select ? of table UNION Null Null
        ->200 ok correct number of col 


    (cleaner)
    way2:
        determined the number of columns
        try1
        -select ? of table order by 4
        ->server error mean col is not exits 
        try2
        -select ? of table order by 3
        ->200 ok correct col 3 exist


#step1 determine data type of colums

    Select varchar , int from table UNION Select int , NULL from table2
    ->error incomtabpel datatype
    select varchar , int from table UNION Select varchar , NULL from table2
    ->200 ok
