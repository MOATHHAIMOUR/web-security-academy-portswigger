SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter

use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables

goal is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query

you should know UNION conditions:
    - tables must have the same number of colums 
    - tables must have the datatype


way1:
    determined the number of columns
    try1
    -select ? of table UNION Null
    ->server error mean that the number of col are not equal 
    try2
    -select ? of table UNION Null Null
    ->200 ok correct number of col 


(cleaner)
way2:
    determined the number of columns
    try1
    -select ? of table order by 4
    ->server error mean col is not exits 
    try2
    -select ? of table order by 3
    ->200 ok correct col 3 exist
